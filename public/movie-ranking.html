<h1>The Best Movies According to Terry</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>I enjoyed the entire Harry Potter series. I believe the reason is I was able to share the movie experience with my kids and it's a memory I reflect on every time I see it.</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Again I enjoyed the entire series simply because it takes you through the journey with all the characters.</p>

<h3>Iron Man</h3>
<p>This was the beginning of the Marvel universe. It started the franchise on a variety of adventures with different heroes but, I would say Iron Man is my favorite.</p>
